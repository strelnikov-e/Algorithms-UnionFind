# AlgorithmsPartOne
Projects for the Princeton University course on algorithms

This is an research of different approaches to Union-Find data structures.

The project includes four data structures:
  Eager approach - O(n2)
  Tree - O(n)
  weighted tree - O(logn)
  weighted tree with path compression 0(logn)
